<?php

// scope: A scope is a context within which the variables or functions you define are isolated from other scopes
//

// php scope:
//  global scope
//  class scope
//  function scope
//

// The big advantage of classes is that they let you define variables and the functions
// that use them together in one place, while keeping the functions hidden from unrelated code.
