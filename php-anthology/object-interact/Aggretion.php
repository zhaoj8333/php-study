// one object uses another object. In many ways,
// such interactions are more important than inheritance,
// and this is where the object oriented paradigm shows its real power.
//

// Aggregation occurs when one object is given another object on “temporary loan.”
// The second object will usually be passed to the first through one of the first’s
// member functions. The first object is then able to call methods in the second,
// allowing it to use the functionality stored in the second object for its own purposes.
